## My time at Lambda School

What I learned at Lambda School not only covers the fundamentals of computer science and web development, it gave me the opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge. Not only has Lambda School teach me how to write concise, reusable, and professional code, I also learned how to work in a fast-paced, agile environment and how to work cross-functionally with other Web Developers, UX/UI designers, and Data Scientists. I learned by building real products and will graduate with over 1200 hours of coding experience, not including the countless hours I spend coding personal projects.
